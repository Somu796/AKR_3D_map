abstract = {Abstract Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) is the strongest terrestrial radio emission, and emanates from the same electron acceleration regions from which particles precipitate into the ionosphere, exciting the aurorae and other phenomena. As such, AKR is a barometer for the state of solar wind - magnetosphere - ionosphere coupling. AKR is anisotropically beamed in a hollow cone from a source region generally found at nightside local times, meaning that a single source region cannot be viewed from all local times in the magnetosphere. In radio data such as dynamic spectra, AKR is frequently observed simultaneously to other radio emissions which can have a similar intensity and frequency range, making it difficult to automatically detect. Building on a previously published pipeline to extract AKR emissions from Wind/WAVES data, in this paper a novel automated AKR burst detection technique is presented and applied to Wind/WAVES data. Over a five year interval, about 5000 AKR bursts are detected with median burst length ranging from about 30 to 60 min. During detected burst windows, higher solar wind velocity is observed, and the interplanetary magnetic field clock angle is observed to tend toward BZ < 0, BY < 0, when compared with the entire statistical interval. Additionally, higher geomagnetic activity is observed during burst windows at polar, high and equatorial latitudes.},
